<h1>Early life</h1>
   <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[11] the third of four
    children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia
    Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's
    side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of
    immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on
    his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[6] Growing up in a
    tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the
    sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers,
    Rodrigo and Mat√≠as, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi,
    both of whom became professional footballers.[12] At the age of four he
    joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his
    earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia,
    who accompanied him to training and matches.[13] He was greatly affected
    by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a
    devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and
    pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[14][15]</p>

  ionel Messi runs on to Ronaldinho's pass, lets the ball bounce in front of him, and just as it seems he is lining up something more emphatic, he lifts a delicate finish over the advancing goalkeeper.

  He is peeling away in celebration before the ball has even crossed the line, his fists wildly punching the air as he sprints towards the corner of the stadium. He looks like a child.
  
  The goal, in the dying minutes of a 2-0 win over Albacete in May 2005, was the first of his senior career. The one that started it all. But Messi's extraordinary potential had long been known to everyone inside Barcelona.
  
  It is what prompted a panicked club executive, fearful that he might slip through their fingers, to sign him on a restaurant napkin at the age of 12. It is why he was training with Ronaldinho and the rest only four years later, then scoring at a packed Camp Nou not long after that.

  Messi excelled at academy level in between, a continuation of his performances for Newell's Old Boys in Argentina, where former coaches and team-mates remember a little phenomenon who ran rings around opponents and racked up hundreds of goals.

  He produced similarly impressive scoring feats at Barcelona, receiving the growth hormone deficiency treatment his previous club could not afford and starring in a legendary youth side which included Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique.
  
  That duo would have to wait for their chances. Not Messi.
  
  Barcelona were a winning team at the time of his emergence from La Masia. There were back-to-back La Liga titles under Frank Rijkaard between 2004 and 2006. At the end of the second of those seasons, they won the Champions League for the first time since 1992.
  
  Messi played no part in the final, a 2-1 win over Arsenal in Paris, due to a torn hamstring, but he was already becoming a prominent and popular figure in the first team.

  Ronaldinho called him his "little brother". The fans adored him. His total of 17 goals in the 2006/07 campaign included a sensational individual effort against Getafe which was uncanny in its likeness to Diego Maradona's slaloming World Cup strike against England in 1986.

  "So, you can copy a work of art after all," wrote Alfredo Relano in Spanish newspaper AS.
  
  Messi's progress continued in the subsequent season but Barcelona's fortunes were on the wane.
  
  Their consecutive La Liga titles were followed by second and third-placed finishes and they fell short in the cup competitions too.
  
  Rijkaard's tenure was ending; Pep Guardiola's was about to begin.
  
  The managerial change would prove significant for Messi.
